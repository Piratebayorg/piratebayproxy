The Pirate Bay !
========================================================

`The Pirate Bay <https://piratebay-proxys.com/>`__ was developed by a Swedish citizen named Piratbyran in 2003, who created the website that provides information unrestrictedly on torrent files. While many individuals are using this portal to download various files, there are also many people working on it in order to share them.

This service runs primarily through peer-to-peer connections, where users share resources and get people to access files using the client software. This torrent website primarily focuses on sharing files that are too big for an individual's internet connection. From these small pieces of metadata, it creates a torrent file, which is usually called a BitTorrent file.

For several years, TPB has grown and improved their users’ experience. One of the perks that the site offers is its diverse selection of categories, such as video games, music apps, and porno.

One thing users will love about this torrent site is that it now has a Browse feature. This latest feature enables every user to search for their desired files without requiring them to visit each category included.

The Pirate Bay, also offers high-resolution content, including movies, comics and audio books. If you love 3D printable items and want to get them as soon as possible, be sure to visit TPB.

You can now download 3D printable models of many things from torrent websites, such as the number of seeders and leechers, date posted, file name, and more. Physibles has made it easy for users to get the things they want by making it a simple task to search for torrents with preferred parameters.

This platform was founded and developed by Piratbryan, which represents the The Piracy Bureau, a Swedish anti-copyright and pro-culture organization. According to the researchers, Fredrik Neij, Peter Sunde, and Gottfrid Svartholm are the first administrators who run the platform. Peter Sunde is also known to be a founder of the pirate bay.

Unlike its predecessor, TPB was unstructured and only served to share files. With a development team that wanted to create the file-sharing platform of the future, it first worked simply as a website to help distribute knowledge and information.

Following the development of this software, Gottfrid Svartholm hosted it without permission in a Mexican based company. The co-founder of the project was Fredrik Neij and a Swedish appeal to the Court went unanswered in November 2010.

In 2004, The Pirate Bay established millions of users worldwide and share more than 60,000 torrent files, magnet links, and information. This is more significant than what a 256 MB RAM capacity can hold.

With a growing volume of content, it is easy and convenient to download games, movies, applications and many more with an integrated client for downloading files for free in 2009.

If you want high-quality content, research the seeders of the different versions to determine which is most popular. In December 2010, the site became a free and open-source platform for sharing.

TPB had a lot of happenings in December 2013. The website gained improvements. In December 2012, TPB changed and improved the homepage (website). Way back on December 8, 2014, most software related to TPB got removed from Google play (online store). But TPB recovered it. You may notice that most happening on the website happened in December in different years due to unknown reasons/explained in detail later on.
